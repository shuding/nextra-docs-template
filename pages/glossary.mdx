# Glossary

## Application Binary Interface (ABI)

An interface that facilitates interaction between two binary program modules. Often, one of these is a library, and the other is a program dynamically linked to the library.

## Contract Address

A unique identifier for a smart contract on the blockchain.

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

A type of organization represented by encoded rules, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government.

## Delegation

The act of assigning one's voting power to another member of the DAO.

## Ethereum Name Service (ENS)

A decentralized domain name system built on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for human-readable addresses.

## ERC-20 Tokens

A common type of cryptocurrency token on the Ethereum blockchain, following a specific standard for implementation.

## Exit Amount

The total value a DAO member would receive if they decided to exit the DAO.

## Grace Period

The set amount of time after voting has ended where those who disagreed with the decision can exit the DAO.

## Guild Kick

A proposal to forcefully remove a member from the DAO, converting their voting tokens into non-voting tokens and removing their voting power.

## Lens Profile

[Profile NFT](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/profile) in the Lens Protocol.

## Metadata

Data that provides information about other data, in this case the data associated with a DAO and it's members.

## Minimum Retention

Maximum percentage of DAO tokens (voting and non-voting) required to remain in the DAO after grace period. If the percentage falls below this number, the proposal is not executed.

## Moloch DAO

Named after the ancient Canaanite god associated with child sacrifice, Moloch DAO is a unique type of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Its structure is intended to encourage members to make sacrifices for the common good, with mechanisms like "Ragequit" allowing dissatisfied members to exit the DAO with their portion of the treasury. It serves as a model for a new type of organizational governance that aims to solve collective action problems among decentralized groups.

## Multicall Proposal

A proposal that consists of multiple actions, allowing for complex transactions to be bundled into a single vote.

## New Offering

Fee of native tokens required to submit proposals, helping to guard against spam. Offerings go into the DAO treasury.

## Non-Voting Tokens

Tokens that provide a proportional ownership stake in the DAO's treasury but do not offer voting rights.

## Proposal

A formal suggestion presented for consideration or decision by the DAO members.

## Quorum

The percentage of DAO members (voting tokens) that must participate for a vote to be valid.

## Ragequit

The act of a member burning voting or non-voting tokens to receive a proportional amount of tokens from the DAO's treasury.

## [Safe](https://safe.global/)

Decentralized custody protocol and secure storage for the DAO's assets, often referring to a smart contract which securely stores the DAO's funds.

## Shaman

A term used to refer to administrative contracts in some DAOs, responsible for managing and guiding the DAO's operations.

## Smart Contract

Self-executing contracts where the terms of the agreement are directly written into code, often used in blockchain technologies for automated and decentralized transactions.

## Sponsor Threshold

Minimum number of voting stake tokens a member needs to sponsor a proposal.

## Structural Benevolence

A characteristic of an organizational structure that inherently prevents bias or prejudice against certain members, characteristic of Moloch-style DAOs.

## Summon

The act of deploying contracts to create a new DAO.

## Summoner

The initial member or group of members responsible for creating the DAO.

## Token

A digital representation of a particular asset or utility.

## Treasury

The fund pool that holds the DAO's assets.

## Voting Period

The set amount of time that members have to vote on a proposal.

## Voting Tokens

Tokens that confer voting rights and a proportional ownership stake in the DAO's treasury.

## [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/)

An open-source protocol for connecting decentralized applications to wallets, allowing for secure interactions between the two.
